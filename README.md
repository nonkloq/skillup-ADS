# Air Quality Analysis and Prediction in Tamil Nadu

Skill Up Applied Data Science Course Project, Project 9

**Project Title:** Air Q Assessment TN

**Problem Statement:** The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize air quality data from various monitoring stations in Tamil Nadu. The dataset contains measurements of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), and Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter/Particulate Matter 10 (RSPM/PM10) levels in different cities, towns, villages, and areas. The project aims to gain insights into the air pollution trends, identify areas with high pollution levels, and create a predictive model to estimate RSPM/PM10 levels based on SO2 and NO2 levels.

## Replicating the Results

To replicate the results of our air quality analysis and prediction project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone our project repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/nonkloq/skillup-ADS.git
    ```

2. **Set Up the Environment:** Ensure you have the required Python environment set up (Python >= 3.10). You can create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies by running:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run all and Explore The IPY Notebook:** Open and run all the cells in this notebook [aq-analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/nonkloq/skillup-ADS/blob/main/aq-analysis.ipynb) to reproduce the data analysis, visualizations, and predictive model. Make sure to follow the instructions and comments within the notebook for guidance.

By following these steps, you can replicate our air quality analysis and prediction results and further explore the data and models to gain valuable insights into air quality in Tamil Nadu.
